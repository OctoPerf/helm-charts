# OctoPerf Kubernetes Helm Charts

This functionality is in beta status and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. OctoPerf will take a best effort approach to fix any issues, but beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Charts

Please look in the chart directories for the documentation for each chart. These helm charts are designed to be a lightweight way to configure our official docker images. Links to the relevant docker image documentation has also been added below.
